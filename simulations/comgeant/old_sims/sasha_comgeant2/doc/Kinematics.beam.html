The beam momentum is simulated within the limits defined by BEAMOMLIM. There
are two ways to simulate the momentum distribution. A spectrum can be specified
using the command BEAMSPEC where the first parameter is the number of points
and the rest are the values of the distribution. If the number of point is set
to 0 then the Gaussian distribution is assumed with a relative sigma defined
by BEAMDISPE. The beam spot is defined at a certain X coordinate (see
BEAMXREFR). There are 4 parameters involved - Y,Z and the slopes in Y and Z.
The limits on all parameters are set with BEAMYZLIM. The slopes and coordinates
in each projection may be correlated (see BEAMSLOPCOR). The beam profiles
on Y and Z are defined with the commands (BEAMDIMY,BEAMDISTY;
BEAMDIMZ,BEAMDISTZ).
<p>
There are two ways to handle the beam. It may be forced to interact in every
event somewhere in the <a href="#target">target</a>, which should be also
defined. In this case possible decays or interactions of the beam particles on
their way are ignored. Another way is to treat the beam particle as other
particles, so it may decay or interact anywhere. The former way is the regular
way to simulate some processes while the latter may be used for some special
purposes. The modes are selected with:
<pre>
C -----------            Beam -------------------
C
OMBEAM     1      beam interacts always
C  OMBEAM   2      beam may pass through
</pre>
In the former mode the beam origin is set to the interaction point and its
momentum in the KINE bank is opposite to its normal momentum. Thus tracking
of the beam is done backwards which might sound bizarre, but it allows to have
a beam interaction in each event and also take into account the multiple
scattering of the beam particle. Since the beam particle may interact or decay
on its way back which is not desirable it would be better to specify
a special type of the beam particle. For example the beam Sigma- are
specified in the following way:
<pre>
C                Special Sigma- (no decay, no hadron interaction)
PARTICLS03   43  5  1.1974 -1.  1.479E-10 'Sigma- no dec,hadr $'
</pre>
The <i>muon</i> tracking type is selected in order to avoid hadronic interactions.
