<h3>Beam pileup</h3>
</a>
One may simulate the beam pileup turning on the command:
<pre>
PILEUP    2.E7   300.
</pre>
In this example it is assumed that the beam flux is 2.E7 per second. The time
interval in which the spurious beam tracks will be simulated is from -300ns to
+300ns. The main beam track comes at the time zero. It is reasonable to specify
the time interval matching the time resolution of the slowest detector. For 
example it may be a drift chamber with maximum drift time of 300ns. The spurious
beam tracks are just
normal tracks of the beam type, which are traced through the setup taking
into account the proper interactions. When a spurious track or its products
crosses a detector the timing of the hit is considered.<p>

Sometimes it is convenient to simulate beam particles of a special type -
say Sigma- which does not decay and does not interact hadronically
while traced by GEANT. A new particle type can by defined. This particle
would have the same properties as an ordinary Sigma-, but the lifetime
is set to infinity and the muon-type of tracking (=5) is taken. However
for calculations of pileup one has to define an ordinary Sigma-:
<pre>
PILEUP    2.E7   300.  21
</pre>
If the third field =0 the beam type of particle is taken.
