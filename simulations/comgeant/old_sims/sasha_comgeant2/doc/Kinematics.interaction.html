<h3>Initial interaction</h3>
</a>
The initial interaction consists of two step. Both steps are optional,
i.e. they may be turned off.
<ol>
 <li> <a name="inclusive"><b>Inclusive production</b></a>. One may simulate one
   or two particles in
   accordance with the given distribution of X<sub>F</sub> and
   P<sub>t</sub>. This type of kinematics is normally used to simulate the charm
   particles production or just some single particle production. The following
   example is used for simulating the inclusive production of D<sup>*-</sup>
   and D<sup>+</sup>:

   </pre>
      The differential cross-section of both particles is
      proportional to
   <pre>
   (1-X<sub>F</sub>)**5*EXP(-1.*P<sub>t</sub>**2).
   </pre>
   X<sub>F</sub> of two particles are not correlated while there is a strong
   correlation in P<sub>t</sub> (the given PT2KIN parameters are tuned to
   describe a measurement from WA92). The command INCLKIN provides the minimum
   possible reaction. In this case only 2 first particles are stored but the
   X<sub>F</sub> value is estimated taking two protons into account.  
   Since only a part of the full energy is
   used for these two particles one may try to use the rest of the energy in
   to simulate the multiplicity in the interaction. A simple mechanism is
   implemented in order to do this. The rest of the momentum in the CM frame is
   given to a virtual particle which type is set by TYRESTKIN. This virtual
   "new beam" may interact with the target using some multiplicity generator
   like FRITIOF (see the next point). Defining the type one should try to keep
   a balance of strangeness and the baryon number.
   <p>
   For inclusive production of a single particle one may use the following
   commands:
<pre>
KINCHARM     0            inclusive kinematics 
NINCLKIN     1            number of particles produced inclusively

</pre>

     If NINCLKIN is set to 0 no inclusive particle is produced.
     <p>

  <li><a name="exclusive"><b>Exclusive generators</b></a>.
    After the inclusive production is checked
    the "beam" particle either stays as is was (if no inclusive production
    was simulated) or is modified. This new "beam" particle may be used to
    simulate the following processes depending on the flag N:
    <pre>
    OMKINE       N
    </pre>
    where:
    <ul>
     <li> 0 - primitive multiplicity, controlled  by the command TMPKINE
     <li> 1 - PYTHIA
     <li> 2 - FRITIOF (hadron interactions with nuclei) - normally used
     <li> 3 - VENUS   (something close to FRITIOF but I have not used it)
     <li> 4 - user's routine OEXCLGEN(ntgen) routine is called, reserved for
       an exclusive production. Another user's routine OEXCLINI is called at the
       initialisation stage. The routine OEXCLGEN should store the new
       particles in the KINE bank and return the number of stored particles in
       the call parameter 'ntgen'.
     <li> 5 - <A HREF="omkine.5.html">Leptoproduction</A> (starting with the
               <A HREF="vers32">version 3.2</A>) 
    </ul>
    <p>
    The <a name="primitive m">"primitive multiplicity"</a>
     option just generates several given particles,
    for example:
    <pre>
    C particle#     1    2    3  (up to 5)
    TMPKINE         2    2    2     multiplicities
                21= 8    9    7     particle types
                41= 1.   1.   2.    min P (flat distribution between min and max)
                61=50. 100.  20.    max P
                81= 1.   1.   1.    =b - mean P<sub>t</sub>**2, EXP(-pt**2/b)
    </pre>
    If all multiplicities are set to 0 and OMKINE =0 - nothing is generated.
   <p>
  <li><a name="interflund"><b>Interface to LUND</b></a>.
    <p>
    The types of LUND particles to be copied to the GEANT structure
    are predefined in the code and can be modified by a command
    (starting with <a href="#vers32">version 3.2</a>):
    <pre>
    LUNDSTOR  21=3112     41=3112           Sigma minus
    </pre>
    In this example 21 and 41 are the GEANT numbers while 3112 is the LUND one.
    When the LUND particle array is scanned a particle 3112 will be
    copied to its first occurence in the LUNDSTOR array - to the GEANT type 21.  
    A call to FRITIOF uses the LUNDSTOR array in the opposite way. 
    It obtains
    the LUND particle code for the GEANT type of the
    beam particle. If the GEANT type of the beam particle
    is 41 (say, a special Sigma- which does not decay or interact strongly)
    its LUND code of 3112 will be taken. In order to pass the particle type to
    FRITIOF one has to specify 
    the name of the particle. The names are stored in the array LUNDSNAM:
    <pre>
    LUNDSNAME   41='NEW1'
    </pre>
    If the name is 'NEW1' its particle code from LUNDSTOR is taken.
    <p>
    The particles produced in the
           <a href="http://xfind.cern.ch/WRITEUPS/KEYWORDS?pythia">LUND</a>
    generators (FRITIOF...) normally decay inside the LUND code. However the
    long living particles like hyperons are transferred to GEANT to decay.
    The codes of these particles are define in the subroutine OMLUNDI. 
    One
    may define other particles to be left to decay in GEANT, for example:
    <pre>
    C               Forbid to decay in LUND for:
    C            pi0   eta   omega  eta'
    LUNDDECOFF   111   221   223    331
    </pre>
    One may also allow the particles to decay in LUND: 
    <pre>
    C               Allow to decay in LUND for:
    C            pi0  
    LUNDDECOFF   111  
    </pre>
    The numbers are given in the LUND notation.
     <p>
    One may set a flag to ignore some types of particles in
    GEANT:
    <pre>
    IGNTYPE      4   ignores neutrinos (up to 10 entries)
    </pre>
    <p>
    There is a way to reject events simulated by LUND generators.
    In this case GEANT skips all the rest processing for this event
    and starts a new one. In case one wants to reject events
    which do not contain certain particles with LUND particle codes
    kf1,kf2...:
    <pre>
    LUNDSELOR  kf1 kf2 kf3 ...  - reject events which contain neither
                                  of these particles
    LUNDSELAND kf1 kf2 kf3 ...  - reject events which do not contain 
                                  at least one of these particles
    </pre>
    If both flags are set the event is rejected if either of the conditions
    is not fulfilled (rejection is "OR-ed").

  <p>
    
</ol>
