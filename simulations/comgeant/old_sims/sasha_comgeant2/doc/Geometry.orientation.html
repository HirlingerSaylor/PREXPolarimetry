<h3>Orientation</h3>
In Omega and some other experiments a coordinate system was used which had
the X axis pointed in the beam direction, and Z pointed upwards. This is the
default orientation of OMGEANT. Most of the definitions of the geometry
are independent on this orientation, except the beam simulation and the
detector simulation.
One may change the orientation using the FFREAD card:
<pre>
DIRDET  n
</pre>
where n=1 by default, or n=3 if the beam goes along Z. (The option to change
the default orientation is implemented but has not been thoroughly checked so far.)
The array IDIRDET(1-3) from /OMCFLA/ defines the orientation used.
<pre>
  variable     meaning             Ex. for the beam along: X  Z
 IDIRDET(1)  - the beam direction                          1  3   
 IDIRDET(2)  - 1-st projection to be measured              2  1  
 IDIRDET(3)  - 2-nd projection to be measured              3  2  
</pre>
