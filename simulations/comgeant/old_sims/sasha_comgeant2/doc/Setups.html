<h2>Setup dependent routines (OUTDATED!!!)</h2>
</a>
Calls to several setup dependent routines have been included in the code
(starting with the <a href="vers32">version 3.2</a>)
<ul>
 <li> WA89 calls depend on the flag SETUPNAME (see <a href="#Geometry">geometry</a>)
   <ul>
    <li> W89TRIG - trigger 
    <li> W89SAVE - write events for TRIDENT 
    <li> W89BGN  - FF cards definitions (called always)
    <li> W89INI  - initialisation
    <li> W89LAST - at the very end
    <li> W89LGHIT - stores the intersections of tracks with the LG calorimeter
   </ul>
 <li> COMPASS calls
   <ul>
    <li> C9RICH1 - called if there is a volume with a name of 'RCH1' in order
      to fill it;
    <li> C9RICH2 - called if there is a volume with a name of 'RCH2' in order
      to fill it
   </ul>
*** the previous explanation is out of date!
Now the Rich1 simulation is driven by the routine 
comgeant/code/src/compass/geomplugs/cgeplu2.F and triggered by the volume
RCH1. The same mechanism will be used for Rich2 and the fine description
of the PT system (these part of the equipments are
considered too complicated to be described by simple FFR cards.
</ul>
