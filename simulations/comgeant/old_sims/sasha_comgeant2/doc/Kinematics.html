One may add new particles and redefine the existing ones using the command:
<pre>
C            #  tracking   mass  charge   tau      name              nuser par user
PARTICLEXX   71  4         2.466  -1.    0.4E-12  'XiC-               $'   0       
</pre>
where XX is an arbitrary number (XX&lt;=95). One may define up to 4 user parameters.
The decays are defined/redefined
using:
<pre>
C          part#    prod  BR
PARDECAYXX   36     110909 8.  160907 4.  100907 4. 16080909 3. 10080909 3.
</pre>
where XX is an arbitrary number (XX&lt;=95). Number of decay modes
per particle is limited
to 50. The GDECAY routine has been considerably modified. The original routine
could handle only 6 decays per particle. Up to 5 decay products are allowed.
Keeping in mind the format of the number used to store the types of decay
particles one should make sure that this number does not exceed 2.E9. It should
not be a problem to put a particle with a type&lt;20 on the fifth place.
<p>
Since it is convenient to define a permanent extension of the GEANT particle
table in a separate FFREAD file similar commands are defined. This commands
should be used only in this separate file: PARTICLSXX and PARDECASXX.
<p>
2-body decays and 3-body decays are simulated with equal weights
using the GEANT tools. 4-body decays are simulated using a routine from OMGEANT
which uses a 2-dimension random generator HRNDM2 from HBOOK. For every
different decay occured
a 2-dim histogram is booked. Again, no weight is attributed to the event.
In the old version (before March,1996)
5-body decays are simulated using a FOWL routine which gives back a weight for
the event, stored in a variable EVWEIT from /OMCEVEN/. Newer versions
simulate 5-body decays with equal weights.
