<h3>Areas</h3>
</a>
Areas which are entities of OMGEANT (not GEANT) are introduced in order to
speed up the tracking. They are used to specify the maximum
sizes of the useful area and roughly define regions with magnetic fields.
The coordinates of the MRS are used (tied to the volume HALL).
Example:
<pre>
C --                       Areas
C
C            start       up to ...
C --   Attention: areas should be a bit wider than the mag. fields
C          beam     target,mag1        mag2
C  area#        1      2      3      4      5      
MEDAREA      1    201      1    201      1      1
MAGAREA      0      2      0      5      0      0
XMNAREA    -500.  -200.   200.  1000.  1500.  4000.
YMXAREA     300.   500.   500.   500.   500.   500.
ZMXAREA     200.   300.   300.   300.   300.   400.
</pre>
The areas are arranged in the X-increasing order.
XNMAREA sets the limits of each area in the X projection.
The YMXAREA/ZMXAREA defines the Y/Z limits of each area. These limits are
used to set the sizes of the 'HALL' volume. Using the command DEADVOL one
may set "dead volumes" beyond each area (between the area and the 'HALL')
where tracking of particles stops. The flag MAGAREA sets whether there
is magnetic field in the area or not. The value defined gives the number
of the magnet used (what field map will be used in this area).
