<h3>Detectors definition</h3>
</a>

In GEANT there is no link from the JSET banks to the instances of the
detectors. In other words, if one looks for a detector with a certain
ISET,IDET numbers within the JSET... structure s/he has no clue how
many instanses there are, unless one looks into the JVOLUM structure.
One may define a detector, say a wire
chamber, and position several copies (instances) of this chamber.
These instances are geometrically identical (for GEANT) but may
be slightly different otherwise, say in their efficiencies. Therefore
it is convenient to store some information on the instances into
the same JSET structure. In OMEANT there are two types of detectors:
those which have some internal structure different instance-wise,
each instance is called "unit", and those which have no internal
structure and no additional information is stored (hodoscopes, for example).
<p>
GEANT identifies a detector using a path of significant volumes and their
copy (instance) numbers. Therefore a detector index may have several dimensions.
In order to simplify the numbering of detectors OMGEANT uses only one-dimension
index, so a detector should be identified with only one pair - the volume name
and the instance number.
<p>
Only plane detectors are supported at the moment.
A detector should be defined
as a volume filled with a sensitive medium.  
A plane coordinate detector measures one (or two) projections of the track crossings 
with the detector volume. The measurement is done in the Detector Reference Frame
(DRS) where the BOX shaped volume is defined. By definition, the plane of the
measurement is normal to the axis IDIRDET(1)=I of the box
(see a note on <a href="#orientation">orientation</a>).
If IDIRDET(1)=1
(beam along X) then the measurement is done in the Y-Z plane of DRS.
If IDIRDET(1)=3
(beam along Z) then the measurement is done in the X-Y plane of DRS.
One may define the plane detectors: MWPC, DC, micro-strips, MSGC (they are treated
like MWPCs at the moment), scintillator hodoscopes and calorimeter hoposcopes. 
The types of the coordinate detectors are set in the following way:
<ul>
 <li> 1-30 - plane chambers, microstrips
   <ul>
    <li>  1-10 - MWPC
    <li> 11-20 - DC
    <li> 21-25 - silicon micro-strips
    <li> 26-30 - MSGC
   </ul>

 <li> 41-50 - hodoscopes
  <ul>
    <li> 41-45 - 'normal' hits/digitizings (as for MWPC...) useful for scintillator hodoscopes
    <li> 46-50 - merge the hits from each track, useful for calorimeters (see
		 GSCHIT)
  </ul>
</ul>
In GEANT detectors are
grouped using their names 'SETS' and 'DETS'. There are many possible ways
to arrange these 'SETS' and 'DETS'. OMGEANT uses one of these ways:
<ul>
 <li> <a name="coordet"> <b>Coordinate detectors</b> </a>.
   One 'set' may contain several detectors 'det'. Let us suppose there is a MWPC
   with 3 separate planes in one gas volume.
   One defines some 'set' name (3 symbols), say MWP. This will become
   the name of the volume for the full chamber containing sensitive media,
   frames etc.
   This volume (or its daughter volume)
   may contain
   several (say, 3) detectors which names 'DETS' would be: MWP1,MWP2,MWP3.
   These detectors are defined by volumes with the same names.
   <!- These volumes 
       should NOT contain other volumes. ->
   The medium of a detector volume should 
   be decleared sensitive.
   One may position the volume 'MWP' wherever one wants. So, there might be
   many detectors of the set='MWP', det='MWP1'. They are distinguished by
   the number of the volume 'MWP'. Examples:

Commands SETXX... refer to the set number XX. Inside this set of
MWPC there 3 detectors. One detector is one plane of MWPC. The number of
detectors 'ndet' is defined by the commands for "planes": SETXXPLA1PAR ...
In order to specify all volumes involved there are commands SETXXVOL1PAR and
the volumes for the planes (3 in this case) are the first 'ndet' volumes in
the list. The mother volume is specified by its number in the same list. All
the planes in the example are put into the volume #4 defined by the command
SET01VOL4PAR. The main volume of the 'set' is here the volume #6 for which
the mother volume has the #0. These volumes identify the real chambers and
they are positioned in the setup using the commands: SETXXUNIMOTH ...
One such detector is called one unit. The full number of units is given by
SETXXUNITS command. One may give the position of the center of the set volume
but it is also possible to use the position of the first plane in X projection.
One may also adjust the lateral position of the chamber using the coordinates
of the first wires: see SETXXDETWIRY,SETXXDETWIRZ. The commands SETXXDET...
refer to all planes in all units. The identifier SET01DETID is used by 
reconstruction programs (the example presents TRIDENT identifiers for Omega
A-chambers). The GEANT definition of the coordinate detectors is done via
the call:
<pre>
            CALL GSDET(namset,namdet,nv,namesv(1),nbitsv(1),idtype,400,400
     +                 ,idset,iddet)
</pre>
where nv=1, namesv(1)=namset and nbitsv(1) depends on the number of units.
<p>
<a name="warning1"><b>Warning</b></a>
   I tried to use the routine GSDETV which should
  fill the detector descriptors (nv,namesv,nbitsv) automatically.
  Unfortunately it did not work for cases when detectors of the same type,
  say 'MWP' were positioned to different levels of the volume tree,
  for example some were positioned in 'HALL' while others in 'TBEN'
  which in its turn was positioned in 'HALL'.
<p>
For each detector 'namdet' a number of additional parameters are stored using:
<pre>
            CALL GSDETU(namset,namdet,14,paruni(1))
</pre>
where the (REAL) parameters paruni are: <br>
<pre>
  1    -  full number of units
  2    -  number of wires
  3    -  wire pitch
  4    -  cos(ang) where ang is the angle of the readout direction with respect
          to the axis II of the detector frame
  5       sin(ang)
  6    -  distance from the first wire to the origin of the detector volume
  7-9  -  X,Y,Z (in DRS) coordinates of a point on the first wire. Only one
          projection (say 'II') in DRS has a non-sero value 
 10-12 -  the same components of the pitch
 13    -  the detector box size in the 'II' direction 
 14    -  the time gate length (ns) 
</pre>
The 'user' bank which contain this information has a pointer of LQ(jdet-3)
(GEANT default). OMGEANT adds 'nunits' links to this bank, where 'nunits' is
the number of units. Each link contains a bank with parameters of this unit,
filled with:
<pre>
      CALL OMSDETU(NAMESET(iset),vnam(ivol),iuni
     +                    ,npardet,pardet(1)
     +                    ,ntpath,nampath(1,ipla),ipath(1,ipla))
</pre>
where ntpath,nampath and ipath define the volume path to the detector plane and
the parameters pardet are:
<pre>
  1    -  ID of the plane (used for reconstruction)
  2-3  -  II,III coordinates of a point on the first wire
  4    -  efficiency of the plane
  5    -  background level
  6-?  -  additional parameters
          DC:
        1 - v - drift velocity (in cm/time_bin)
        2 - t0 (measured t=t0-dist/v)
        3 - two hit resolution (in units of time bins)
        4 - space resolution (in units of time bins)
        5 - the time bin length (in ns) 
</pre>
The information can be retrieved by:
<pre>
      CALL OMFDETU(IUSET,IUDET,IUNI,MXDPUS,nwpar,pardet(1)
     +            ,nulev,nunam(1),nunum(1))
</pre>
The drift parameters are defined using cards of the type as follows:
<pre>
GSET05DETVELO     200*0.005                             drift velocity
GSET05DETTIM0     200*80.                               time zero
GSET05DETDRES     200*900.            double hit resolution (in time slices)

GSET05DETSLIC     200*1.              time slices in ns
</pre>
<p>
Key names with different prefixes can be used to define a detector set:
<pre>
GSET...XX   where 01&lt;=XX&lt;=30   for general geometry files

   A hodoscope is a volume called 'HODX' in this case 'HOD1' filled with
   rectangular slates, of similar or different types (sizes).
   The sizes are defined by the command HODXSIZE1, HODXSIZE2... for each type.
   Each slate
   gets its unique
   number, disregarding of its type. This number is used in the definitions
   HODXPOSX, HODXPOSY, HODXPOSZ, HODXTYPE, HODXEFFI and HODXBACK.
   At the moment the number
   of hodoscopes is limited to 8, the number of slates per hodoscope to 256,
   the number of slate types to 2.
   The 'set' name is always 'HODO'. A slate is a volume
   which gets a name
   of 'HOXN', where X is the hodoscope number and N is the slate type number.
   This name is used for the 'detector' name. 
   Thus there are many copies of each 'detector' inside one hodoscope.
   A hit should be identified by the 'detector' name and the copy number.

   <p>The "automatic" GSDETV routine is used at the moment to specify the hodoscopes,
   therefore it is recommended to position them on one level
   of the volume tree (see the <a href="#warning1">warning</a>).
   
For each detector 'namdet' a number of additional parameters are stored using:
<pre>
            CALL GSDETU(namset,namdet,NN,paruni(1))
</pre>
where the (REAL) parameters paruni are: <br>
<pre>
  1    -  the number of slates of the current type
  2    -  the number of different types of slates for this hodoscope
  3    -  time gate
  4    -  the total number of slates in this hodoscope
            for all slates of the current type:
  5    -  1-st slate of this type: the serial number of this slate (disregarding the type) 
  6    -  1-st slate of this type: efficiency 
  7    -  1-st slate of this type: background 
  8    -  2-st slate of this type: the serial number of this slate (disregarding the type) 
  9    -  2-st slate of this type: efficiency 
 10    -  2-st slate of this type: background 
 ...   - .......
</pre>

</ul>
