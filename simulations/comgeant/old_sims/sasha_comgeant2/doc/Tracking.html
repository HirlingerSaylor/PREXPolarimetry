<h2>Tracking</h2>
</a>
Tracking is turned on by the command:
<pre>
OMTRACK   1
</pre>
<a name="dabsorbers">
<h3>Dead absorbers</h3>
</a>
The tracking is mainly done by GEANT. There are several options implemented in
OMGEANT mainly in order to speed up the computing. One may declare a "dead
absorber" either for all particles or for particles of some certain types. The
<a name="dead a">command</a>:
<pre>
DEADVOL 99
</pre>
requires that all particles should be stopped when entering the medium 99. This
medium should have been of course declared. The command also inserts "dead
volumes" - some boxes around the setup which fill the space between the 'HALL'
walls and the maximum sizes of the areas declared by XMNAREA,YMXAREA and
ZMXAREA.
<p> One may also declare up to 9 media be opaque for certain types of tracks:
<pre>
C
C       Absorbers: 
C         medium      tracking types
MEDABSORB1   54        1  2  3  4  7      photons electrons hadrons
MEDABSORB2   95        1  2  3  4  7      photons electrons hadrons
MEDABSORB3  295        1  2  3  4  7      photons electrons hadrons
</pre>

<a name="newparticles">
<h3>New particles</h3>
</a>
New particles may be produces on the tracking stage as the result of decays
or interactions. Storing of all new particles to the KINE bank including
the shower elements may
cause memory problems. Therefore by default
only the products of decays are stored in the KINE bank and thus get
a number 'itra'. The products of interactions are not stored in the KINE.
While tracking they have the 'itra' number of the mother particle.
One may change this 'storing rule'  using the command:
<pre>
C === "storing of new particles" 0 - decays,
C                                1 - + hadron interactions 
C                                2 - all processes
ONEWKINE    2

<a name="tflight">
<h3>Time of flight</h3>
</a>
While tracking GEANT calculates the time of flight of a particle
using the time offset stored in the origin vertex bank. These offsets
are stored by GSVERT using the current value of the variable TOFG
from /GCTRAC/, reset to 0 by GEANT at the event initialisation.
In OMGEANT a "zero time point" should be defined using the command:
<pre>
XYZTIME0  -1500. 0. 0.  (or something like that)
</pre>
It is logical to set this point at a place where the beam enters
the setup.
The primary vertex is assigned a time needed for the beam to
come from the "zero time point" to this vertex.

<a name="Hits">
<h2>Hits</h2>
</a>
Calculation and storing of hits is turned on by the command:
<pre>
OMHITS   1
</pre>
At the moment all types of detectors are treated in the same way.
All tracks which give at least one hit in detectors are marked and counted
as "trajectories". For intersections of tracks with sensitive volumes of the
detector planes the coordinates of the entrance and exit points are stored.
The centre of the line between this points is calculated.
The timing of the hit is checked - it should be within -tgate:tgate interval,
where tgate is the time gate of the detector set (see SETXXGATE).
For a given
trajectory (track)
the following information is stored in the GEANT hits banks (via CALL GSAHIT):
<ul>
 <li> <i>32bit</i> words 1-3 - X,Y,Z of the centre of the track crossing with the sensitive
   volume in the MRS;
 <li> <i>32bit</i> words 4-6 - the X,Y,Z of the entrance point in the DRS (detector refer. system)
 <li> <i>32bit</i> words 7-9 - the X,Y,Z of the exit point in the DRS (detector refer. system)
 <li> <i>32bit</i> word 10   - full energy deposit in the sensitive volume;
 <li> <i>32bit</i> word 11   - ionisation energy deposit in the sensitive volume (at the
   moment does not differ from the full energy deposit);
 <li> <i>32bit</i> word 12   - momentum;
 <li> <i>08bit</i> word 13   - the track type if this hit is caused by a
   product of 
   the original track or
   0 if it is caused by the original track;
 <li> <i>24bit</i> word 14   - "reduced time of flight": the difference between 
                  the actual time of flight and the time needed for light
                  to reach this point from the "zero time point" XYZTIME0,
                  the value; for the beam this value is set to 0. This
                  value is used for the drift chamber digitisation.
</ul>
   <p align=center><i>Filled starting with the <a href="#vers32">version 3.2</a></i></p>
<ul>
 <li> <i>32bit</i> word 15-17
                - direction cosines in MRS at the enterance point.
 <li> <i>16bit</i> word 18   - the serial number of this hit on the track (only
                  hits in the detectors are considered). 
 <li> <i>32bit</i> word 19   - the additive response of the detector (for 'calorimeters' -
                               see also hodoscopes IDTYP=46..)
                   At the moment = the ionisation losses.
</ul>
<p>
At the moment calorimeters are not treated as GEANT detectors. For WA89 there
is a patch allowing to store the hits with the Lead Glass calorimeter. For that 
the volume with the "lead glass" sensitive medium should be called 'LG',
or one redefined by the FF command:
<pre>
LGVNAME 'LGS '
</pre>
Then
the hits of all tracks with its surface will be stored and written out in
the <a href="#trident output">TRIDENT output</a> format. They can be treated
in <a href="http://vsnhd1.cern.ch/offline/phynix/">PHYNIX</a>. Another way
to write out the hit information including all sensitive media is described
in the <a href="#hits output">Hits output</a> section.
