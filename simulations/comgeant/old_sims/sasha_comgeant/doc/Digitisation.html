<h2>Digitisation</h2>
</a>
Digitisation is turned on by the command:
<pre>
OMDIGI   1
</pre>
Plane coordinate detectors and hodoscopes are treated.
The results are stored in the regular GEANT digitisation
banks (via CALL GSDIGI).
<ul>
 <li> <b>MWPC</b> <br>
      A track may hit one or several wires, depending on
      the length of the projection of
      its trajectory inside the sensitive volume on the wire plane.
      All hit wires are combined in clusters
      if there is no gap between them. The maximum length of a cluster
      is 16 wires. The following words are stored:
   <ol>
    <li> 16 bits: the number of the first wire in a cluster (name:WIRE);
    <li> 16 bits: the number of wires in a cluster (name:WIDT);
   </ol>
 <li> <b>Silicon micro-strips (SMS)</b><br>
      At the moment they are treated like MWPC.
 <li> <b>MSGC</b><br>
      At the moment they are treated like MWPC.
 <li> <b>Drift</b> chambers<br>
      The distance between
      the center of a track trajectory inside the sensitive volume
      and the closest wire is calculated
      (a track may hit only one wire).
      The drift time in unit of time bins is
      calculated as
      time=INT((dist/velocity)+smearing+RTOF)
      where smearing simulates the resolution (Gaussian distribution)
      and RTOF is the "reduced time of flight" (see <a href="#Hits">Hits</a>).
      The resolution
      is given in the description of the chamber.
      The following words are stored:
   <ol>
    <li> 16 bits: the number of the wire (name:WIRE);
    <li> 16 bits: the time in units of time bins (name:TIME);
   </ol>
 <li> <b>Hodoscopes</b> <br>
      Each slate is identified by its 'detector' name and the copy number. 
      The ionisation energy release per slate is calculated. 
      The following words are stored:
   <ol>
    <li> 16 bits: the energy (GeV)*1.E4 (name:EION);
   </ol>
</ul>
