The simplest solenoid available is a ``box'' like one
(a cilinder 305 cm long with an internal radius of 40 cm
with the field along the beam axis) described by the
omagfld3.F.
The field in the example is
is 25 kG but can be changed at will.

This is activated by the following card:

<PRE>
C        Xcen  Ycen  Zcen   rot   bfield  unused kflag
MAGNET3     0.    0.    0.    0    25.      0.    0 
C
</PRE>

Other options have been implemented:
With kflag=1 omgfld3c.F is used to provide the presently
available calculation of the PT magnet done by Oxford.
The fringe field of the SM1 is artificially put to
0. 
<PRE>
C        Xcen  Ycen  Zcen   rot   bscale  unused kflag
MAGNET3     0.    0.    0.    0    1.      0.    1 
C
</PRE>

kflag=2 triggers omgfld3b.F (PT + fringe), and
kflag=3 uses omgfld3a.F (fringe only).
Note that to superimpose the fringe fields, the distance
between the PT and the SM1 centres is hardwired.
Due to the mechanism of providing magnetic field to the
tracking implemented in comgeant (Areas), this part
can create funny behaviours: be carefully if you touch
the magnets positions! A new version of the system
PT+SM1 is under study and will be delivered with the
next release.
These last options have not been tested yet.

<P>
Note that:
<UL>
<LI> The position at 0 cm is
     presently the "official" position. This number is hardwired in 
     the routine.
<LI> Note the unused word before the kflag
