<h2>Versions</h2>
</a>

<ul>
 <li> 2.1 - 2.3 based on GEANT 3.15: Obsolete versions.  
 <li> 3.1 based on GEANT 3.21. <br>
   CMZ format. <br>Includes:
   <ul>
    <li> WA89: simulation of the trigger
    <li> Various magnets (sizes and field maps) can be used:
      <ol>
       <li> Omega (omega_field.a library should be linked)
       <li> SM1h - Torino C-shape magnet
       <li> Goliath
       <li> SM1m - large apperture  
       <li> SM2  - (SFM)
      </ol>
      Omega field is taken from omega_field.a library.<br>
      Field for the magnets 2-5 are either taken from dummy.a (simple uniform
      field)
      or magnets.a (real field maps)
   </ul>

 <li> <a name="vers32">3.2</a> <br>
      CVS format.<br>
          A set of modifications was done with respect to the version 3.1
          in order to use OMGEANT for COMPASS. The code was cleaned up and
          WA89 proprietary parts were moved to separate directories/libraries.
   <ul>
    <li> WA89 specific routines were renamed by removing "OM" at the
         beginning and adding "W89" instead. These routines (mainly concerning
         the trigger) were moved to a new directory wa89.
    <li> OMSAVE FF flag is renamed to WA89SAVE.
    <li> In older versions the "reduced time of flight" (the word 14 in the hit
         banks) was calculated as <i>TOF-dist/clight*SIGN</i> where <i>SIGN</i>
         could be negative if X&lt;XYZTIME0(1). This could be useful
         if the zero time point XYZTIME0 were put in a middle of the setup.
         Since this option has not been used the <i>SIGN</i> term is removed.
   </ul>
</ul>
