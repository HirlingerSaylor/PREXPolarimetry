<h2> General information </h2>
</a>
  The OMGEANT program is an interface to 
    <a href="http://wwwcn.cern.ch/pl/geant">GEANT 3.21
    </a> simulation package. It has been used for the
    <a href="http://vsnhd1.cern.ch/">WA89</a> experiment. It may also be used
    for different fixed target experiments. It has been upgraded to be used
    for the <a href="http://wwwcompass.cern.ch/compass/">
   COMPASS (NA58)</a> experiment and since then may be called COMGEANT.
   Nothing on the setup
   geometry is predefined in the code. The geometry data should be stored
   in external data files in the
   <a href="http://consult.cern.ch/writeup/ffread">FFREAD</a> format.
   OMGEANT contains calls to certain kinematic packages like
   <a href="http://xfind.cern.ch/WRITEUPS/KEYWORDS?pythia">JETSET</a>
   (PYTHIA and FRITIOF) and also provides a tool to simulate inclusive
   production of charmed and other particles. The following types of plane
   detectors are properly treated: MWPC, DC, silicon micro-strips,
   scintillator hodoscopes. The hit information can be written out.
   At the moment the digitised information is written out only in
   a special format used in WA89 (ZBOOK banks). The full hit information
   (without digitisation data) can be written out as ZEBRA banks.
   Both batch and interactive versions of OMGEANT-GEANT are provided.
