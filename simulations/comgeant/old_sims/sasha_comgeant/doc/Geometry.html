<h2>Geometry definition</h2>
</a>

Everything but the main mother volume may be defined using the FFREAD commands.
Several FFREAD files may be read one after another thus defining the general
geometry and some particular settings. The later files may redefine
values set by the previous ones. In order to reduce unwanted interference
between different input FFREAD files there are different sets of FFREAD keys
for the same variables.
The main mother volume of the 'BOX' shape called 'HALL' is defined in the code.
The medium number of the 'HALL' is set to 1.
The sizes of the volume 'HALL' are taken from the "..AREA"
definitions (see below).
The center of the master reference frame (MRS) is positioned to the center of
the 'HALL'. Normally the MRS is defined in a way that X goes along the beam
and Z goes up. In fact, another options exist, but they have not been really
tested.
<p>
Starting with the <a href="#vers32">version 3.2</a>
it is possible to pass a name of the setup with the FFREAD card:
<pre>
SETUPNAME  'WA89HY93'
</pre>
The first 4 characters serve for the setup/experiment name and are checked
in the present version of the code. The second 4 characters may be used to
distinguish runs, configurations etc. At the moment the name 'WA89' is used
in the OMGEANT code to check if some WA89 specific routines should be called.
