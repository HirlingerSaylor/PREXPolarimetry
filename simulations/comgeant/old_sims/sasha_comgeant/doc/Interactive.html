<h2>Interactive version</h2>
</a>
One may run OMGEANT interactively. For that an interactive version
has to be compiled with several additional routines from OMGEANT and
with standard CERN graphics and PAW libraries.<p>
In order to store the particle trajectories the bank JXYZ is filled.
Since these banks may occupy a very large space the program may run
out of ZEBRA memory (see /GCBANK/). In order to reduce the number
of stored trajectories in showers several cuts are used
(in this example the default values are given):
<pre>
CUTXYZ  0.005  0.  2.
</pre>
Where the parameters mean the following:
<ol>
 <li> - cut on momenta of e+/-,gamma in showers in heavy material, for steps < 1cm;
 <li> - cut on material density for shower e+/-,gamma
        tracks which do not stop or cross a boundary;
 <li> - cut on step size for shower e+/-,gamma
        tracks which do not stop or cross a boundary.
</ol>
Additionally, the full number of entries to GSXYZ is limited and the limit can
be changed using, say:
<pre>
MAXXYZ  300000
</pre>
The default value depends on the full length of /GCBANK/ KWBANK:
KWBANK/14, which means that JXYZ may fill up to one half of the full
/GCBANK/ length.
