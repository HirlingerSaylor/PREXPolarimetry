<P>All the physics generators for the mu beam programme are linked via
this switch. To distinguish between them a second card has been prepared:</P>

<PRE>MUKIN N
</PRE>

<P>Presently two options are available and a third is ready to be implemented.

<LI><A HREF="#External Files">MUKINE 1</A> this is to read events from
file (unit 25)</LI>

<LI><A HREF="#LEPTO">MUKINE 2</A> this is to steer LEPTO production (DIS
on Nucleons) </LI>

<LI><A HREF="#AROMA">MUKINE 3</A> this is to steer AROMA production (not
yet ready) </LI>
</UL>

<P>Here you can read events from unit 25 written in LeptoDump format. In
principle any LUND based generation can read via this mechanism (basically
the LUJETS common is dumped in a compact form to disc; this allow at least
interchange of files between IBM&nbsp;AIX&nbsp;- CernSP&nbsp;and SUN&nbsp;Solaris
machines, maybe more). The routine to read/write are rdbevt.F and dmpevt.F
(The first one is omgeant/omgbatch/ompro whilst for the second one ask
Massimo Lamanna). </P>

<P>the following cards are used to prepare the appropriate setup for the
Lepto generator (presently Lepto 6.3). </P>

<P>The first 4 cards determine the ranges of x bjorken, y, Q^2 (in GeV2)
and nu (=E'-E in GeV) where the generation will take place. Since these
variables are not independent, the intersection of all ranges is taken;
if the intersection is too small the program can crash at initialization
with no clear message from Lepto. LST and PARL are use to select target
type, distribution function and many other parameters. Please refer to
the LEPTO manual to set up these. </P>

<P>Note also that the lepton type and its energy is not given via this
cards. At initialization time, it is read from the OMBEAM&nbsp;cards and
passed to the Lepto routines. The option LST(17)=1 (variable beam energy)
is switched off (the beam energy is the mean value of the distribution)
because the Lepto manual still warns about its usage.</P>

<P>Note that there is no links yet between GEANT&nbsp;target material and
the Lepto target material.</P>
