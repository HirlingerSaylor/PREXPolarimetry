<a name="Output">
<h2>Data output</h2>
</a>
There are three ways to write out the simulated data:
<ol>
 <li> <a name="#trident output"><b>ZBOOK output for TRIDENT</b></a> can be read by
   <a href="http://vsnhd1.cern.ch/offline/trident/">TRIDENT</a> (the
   reconstruction program of WA89). A special
   ZBOOK bank is filled and written out. The contents of KINE and VERT banks
   are stored and also the hit information including the hit coordinates and
   the results of digitisation. The structure of the bank is documented in the code.
   This ZBOOK bank has 2 links. A bank at the
   first link may contain the 'LG' information (see <a href="#Hits">Hits</a>),
   a bank at the second link may contain the trigger information.
 <li> <a name="#zebra output"><b>ZEBRA output</b></a>. One may write down any
   set of GEANT banks using the SAVE command from GEANT, in the ZEBRA FZ
   format:<br>
   <pre>
   SAVE  'bnk1' 'bnk2' ....
   </pre>
   where bnk1 .. are the names of the banks.<p>
   <h3> General output for hits </h3>
   One may add
   a special hit bank to the GEANT output using the command:
   <pre>
   SAVE 'KINE' 'VERT' 'OHIT'
   </pre>
   If this command is set then a new ZEBRA bank JOHIT is filled. Additionally
   to the hits in detectors hits in all sensitive media are stored. The  
   conditions for storing the hits in detectors are the same as for
   the regular GEANT hit banks - the timing is checked.
   The
   format of this bank look as follows:
   <pre>
                             OHIT format


C---      JOHITS    - a hit bank (special format - INTEGER/REAL values)
C                     booked only if NSAVE>0
C                IQ(JOHITS+1) =ntrj number of trajectories (itrj=1,ntrj)
C                johtj=LQ(JOHITS-itrj)
C                    IQ(johtj+1) = itra (see JKINE)
C                    IQ(johtj+2) = nhits - number of stored hits (ihit=1,nhits)
C                        johth=LQ(johtj-ihit)
C                          
C           Q(johth+1:3) - X,Y,Z of the center of the trajectory in the
C                                   sens. volume. in MRS (main ref. system)
C                             For detectors:
C                   4:6  - X,Y,Z of the enterance point (DRS)
C                   7:9  -       of the exit point
C                            For media
C                   4:6  - X,Y,Z of the enterance point (MRS)
C                   7:9  - 0
C                 10:11  - energy depositions
C                    12  - momentum
C                    13  - =0 if this hit is caused by the "original"
                              track
                           =IPART if the hit is caused by some products
                                  of the original track
                     14  - delay time from the "time zero" point,
                           the minimum flight time to this detector
                           is subtracted
                     15  - icode
                           a) detector:      icode=IDTYEP*1000
                                   types: 1  -  MWPC
                                         11  -  DC

                                         26  - MSGC

                   17:19 - COS X,Y,Z of the track at the enterance point (MRS)<p>
   </pre>
 <li> <a name="#ntuple output"><b>NTUPLE output</b></a>.
   One may write down to a disk a column-wise ntuple (CWN)
   (see <a href="http://consult.cern.ch/writeups/hbook">HBOOK</a>) 
   which may contain several ID:
   <ul>
    <li> ID=1 - written once per job;
    <li> ID=1 - written once per event;
    <li> ID=3 - written once per event (not filled at the moment, but reserved);
   </ul>
   <p>
   These "ID"s contain information as follows:
   <ul>
    <li> ID=1 - information on detectors;
    <li> ID=2 - information on the beam;
    <li> ID=2 - LUND event;
    <li> ID=2 - information on geant tracks;
    <li> ID=2 - information on hits;
    <li> ID=2 - information on digitisations;
   </ul>
   <p>
   <b>Note 1</b>
   since there is a limit in hbook of 50k columns per ID, and because of
   a high multiplicity generated in compass hadron
   simulation with pileup, a few per cent of events may go beyond the limit
   and be truncated. In order to avoid such a case
   in future the hits may be optionally put to a different ID (=3). It will have 
   a drawback, namely it will be more difficult to analyse the ntuple with
   PAW, if one has to get access to different IDs at once.
   Still it will be easy to read and analyse the ntuple from a fortran
   program.
   <p>
   <b>Note 2</b>
   it is forseen that some of the ntuple information (say the LUND record)
   can be read in by GEANT
   and used for simulation. 
   However this feature has not been yet implemented. 
   <p>
   there are several ways to use the ntuple:
   <ul>
    <li> <b>with PAW</b>-type program, or interactive GEANT. In this case one can
      make distributions of different variables using a comis routine (see an
      example in data/examples/cntpr.f)
    <li> <b>from FORTRAN(or C)</b>. One may/should use a set of routines from
          COMGEANT in order to define the variables: omnt?ini.F and the
      appropriate COMMON blocks.\
      To be continued ...
   </ul>
</ol>
