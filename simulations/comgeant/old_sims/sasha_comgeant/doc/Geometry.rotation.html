<h3>Rotation matrices</h3>
</a>

Rotation matrices are defined using the FFREAD commands:
<pre>
C
C --    Rotation matrix
C
RMATR01  90.  90.   0.   0.  90.    0.     I is along Y,II along Z,III along X
RMATR02   0.   0.  90.   0.  90.   90.     I is along Z,II along X,III along Y
RMATR03  90.   0.   0.   0.  90.  270.  Z  I is along X,II along Z,III oppos Y
</pre>
The number XX in RMATRXX defines the rotation matrix number.
