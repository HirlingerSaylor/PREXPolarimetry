This was originally the HMC LoI Magnet (a box field,
typically 1 T over 1 m used to measure the momentum 
of the large angle particles from the polarised target.

Then it has been modeled from the OAFM (Open Axial
Field Magnet) the ISR magnet recently used by Obelix
experiment at LEAR. Since this magnet has been considered
not interesting for us, the very heavy implementation
has been commented out to speed up things.

Now the implemented magnet is a dipole under
consideration in the collaborations. Note that the name OAFM
to define this are has been changed into SM1M (SM1H).

This is activated by the following card:

Note that:
<UL>
<LI> The position at 350 cm from the polarised target is
     presently the "official" position
<LI> bfield is used only in connection of klag=0 to provide
     a box field (along the z direction) on the AREA connected
     to magnet 4
<LI> bscale is a factor to scale up/down  the field
<LI> kflag
     <UL>
     <LI> 0 box field
     	<UL>
             <LI> bfield = Bz (vertical) in the box
     	     <LI> bscale = half of the box size
	</UL>
     <LI> 1 SM1M description via polinomial (not yet implemented)
     <LI> 2 SM1M measured map (the measurement takes into account
          the axial symmetry --ok to 5% level-- on a 5X5cm2 grid). Off
          axis the measured points go up to 160 cm from the axis.
          From 150 cm to 200 cm a 1/r^3 law is chosen. At larger
          distances the field is 0 (probably not yet realistic)
     <LI> 3 free to later use
     </UL>
</UL>

The relevant routines are:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF=../code/src/field/magnets/omagini4.F> 
field/magnets/omagini4.F </A>
called by omgbatch/ompro/omgini.F???. It initialize the relevant
array. In the case kflag=2 it transform the map in cartesian
coordinates and interpolate it on a 1X1X1 cm3 grid.
<LI><A HREF=../code/src/field/magnets/omagfld4.F> 
field/magnets/omagfld4.F </A>
called by omgbatch/ompro/gufld.F. It provides the field to the
tracking.
</UL>

There is the plan to add new measurements or calculation of the
field in presence of the new support (to be built) and with the
extra poles to close the gap (for the p-beam programme).

The mechanics is described in the following way 
(still provisional in particular the yoke)
using the usual COMGEANT mechanisms. 201 is air with magnetic
field for the container SM1M;
295 is iron with magnetic field for poles and yoke.
(Obsolete. It gives the shape of the OAFM).
