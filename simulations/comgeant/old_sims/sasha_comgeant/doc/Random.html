<h2>Random numbers</h2>
</a>
OMGEANT uses the
<a href="http://wwwcn.cern.ch/asdoc/shortwrupsdir/v113/top.html">RANMAR</a>
random runber generatior from
<a href="http://wwwcn1.cern.ch/asd/cernlib/libraries.html">CERNLIB</a>.
Random number generatiors from GEANT (GRNDM) and LUND (RLU) as well as
the old CERNLIB generator RNDM are replaced with the calls to RANMAR.
Three independent sequences are used:
<ol>
 <li> for the beam and inclusive production
 <li> for LUND (FRITIOF, JETSET ...)
 <li> for GEANT (decays, processes ...)
</ol>
Therefore one can simulate identical initial kinematics (before
decays) with different setups.

One can redefine the seeds using the card:
<pre>
RNDMSEQ n
</pre>
where 0&lt;n&lt;1000000 - is an arbitrary number which changes the seeds
for all 3 sequences used. <p>

A snapshot of the random numbers are stored in a file <i>omg_random.dat</i>
at the end of the job. This file can be used to continue the task from the
current position. In order to continue the FF command should be used:
<pre>
CONTINUE  1
</pre>

Unfortunately this mechanism provides 2 rndm.o to the linker (one from
omgbatch.a 
--the modified source sits in 
<A HREF="../omgbatch/ompro/rndm.F">omgbatch/ompro/rndm.F</A>--
and the original from packlib): on some platforms it can make the linker
complain (e.g. Sun-Solaris 2.5) and additional linker option have to be
provided by hand to the linker (e.g. -z muldefs on Sun-Solaris 2.5).
