Dear all,

I am not professor/teacher. Sorry if my instruction is far away of state of
art.

So ...

Link to the archive with required comgeant files on jlabl1 computer is:
/u/scratch/glamazdi/sasha_comgeant.tar.gz
I hope Jim or Paul can copy it from JLab using scp protocol.

Requirements:

1. OS - LINUX
2. cernlib has to be installed.

The archive contains:

1. Directories code/ and code64/ with comgeant executable files for 
32-bits(code/) and 64-bits(code64/) processors. Files *batch* are for running
in batch mode. Files *inter* are for running in interactive mode.

2. Directory data/ contains files with moller polarimeter geometry: 
 - geom_moller_08t.ffr - old Moller polarimeter geometry (before upgrade, just
   for example);
 - geom_moller_t411.ffr - present Moller polarimeter geometry (11 GeV era);
 - *.map - files with field map of the Moller target SC magnet;
 - files with information about materials and particles.

3. Directory doc/ contains Eugen's guide how to run comgeant.

4. Directory example/ contains files with examples of commands to run comgeant
   in batch and interactive mode.

5. ntup_his/ is a directory to store ntuple and other files with results of
   comgeant simulation.

6. Directory paw/ contains files to run comgeant in batch mode. The main file
   to run comgeant or to analyze comgeant results is run_energy.kumac

7. Directory run/ is for interactive mode to test simple different
   configurations. I did not edit links in run/ directory. You can practice
   yourself.

Running COMGEANT

1. Interactive mode.

You can choose either to add *inter*.exe files to bin/ directory, or to add
path to directory with *inter*.exe files or to use full link to *.exe files.

- Type comg_inter.x86_64_d.exe (for 64-bits processor) or 
  comg_inter.rhws3u.exe (for 32-bits)
- line "Workstation type (?=HELP) <CR>=1 :" has to appear. Type 3 (popup
  window size. You can choose another one);
- comgeant window (HIGZ_01@...) has to popup and prompt GEANT> has to appear
  in the main comgeant window;
- type exe plot_setup
- Moller polarimeter layout has to appear in HIGZ... window;
- type exe eve n=10
- 10 red color raytraces from Moller target to detector have to appear on the
  Moller layout.
Bingo! You are running comgeant. Use example/ files and doc/ files to get more
information about comgeant running.

Hints:
a) If you are exiting from comgeant/PAW by using "exit" command file
last.kumac with all commands you entered in the last run is created. If you
are ending comgeant/PAW with "quit" last.kumac file is not created. Using
last.kumac file you can always revise what did you do and repeat it.
b) If you want to change any parameters, use command line or paw/omg.ffr file.
Don't change anything in data/ directory files.

2. Batch mode.

Open run_energy.kumac file in an editor. In run_energy.kumac:
- choose directory to save files with results (hdir=../ntup/his/);
- choose names of files with results (namh, naml, namn);
- depends to your processor choose comment one of the lines:
 shell nice ../code/comg_batch.rhws3u.exe > log
 shell nice ../code64/comg_batch.x86_64_d.exe > log
- you can change number of events and electron beam energy in the first line
  (nev,e);
- you can change magnetic fields in the Moller magnets (q1-q4,dp,fld).
  Also, you can change a lot of parameters in omg_0.ffr file.
  run_energy.umac translates parameters from omg_0.ffr to omg.ffr and
  add/update parameters to omg_0.ffr (beam energy, number of events, magnets
  magnetic fields etc). Take a look on links in paw/ directory to understand
  what files are using for simulation.
- type paw
- line "Workstation type (?=HELP) <CR>=1:" has to appear. Type 3
- comgeant window (HIGZ...) has to popup and prompt PAW> has to appear;
- type exe run_energy nev=1000
- in a short period new histograms in HIGZ... window and results of simulation
  in PAW window will appear;
- type hi/li to see list of histograms;
- type hi/pl (histogram number) to show histogram;
  Use example/ files and doc/ files to get more information.

I hope it should be enough for the early beginning.
E-Mail me or call me (757-269-5441) if you have any questions.
Let me know your results.

Good luck,
Sasha

PS I hope to see you here for more effective comgeant training and wider
cooperation.
