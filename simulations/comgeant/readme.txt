Welcome to COMGEANT! I wish you the best of luck - Ted 6/14

old_sims
	This directory contains the original comgeant files recieved from Sasha in
	the Spring of 2013.

chris_moller_files
	This directory contains the comgeant analysis developed by Chris Persichilli
	in the Spring of 2013.  These files are closely connected with the old_sims.

MP_comgeant_minimal
	This directory contains the most modern rendition of the comgeant simulation
	of the Hall-A Moller Polarimeter.  It includes some geometry updates, but
	even these could be out of date at this point.  The most significant
	developments include dedicated batch and interactive directories, each with
	python front-ends that (in my opinion) simplify the entire running process
	and make it transparent to change simulation parameters.  There were many
	different versions of this model between Sasha's initial simulation and this
	version, none of which are included here.  If you want any of the
	development files, or just have any questions feel free to contact me.
