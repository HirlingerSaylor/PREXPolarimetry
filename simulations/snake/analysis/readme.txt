mCoincident.py takes files dFse.txt, dRse.txt, and dAngs.txt generated by
Snake.py, locates coincident events based on positions at the final detector
endplane, and produces the file dCoincident.txt with the format
(thetcm,phicm,anp,x_f,x_r,y_f,y_r,z_f,z_r), angles are in degrees, lengths in
mm, and anp in analyzing power.

Note the difference between f/r designations (formard and reverse scattered)
and l/r designations (left and right arm).  The f/r designation is more
accurate (even for GEANT), and it just so happens that the r in f/r corresponds
directly to the r in l/r for phi centered around 0 in such a way that the dual
acceptance region for phi around 180 is excluded.  If Moller scattering events
are considered for phi near 180 degrees, the l/r designation breaks down.

The plotting files are fairly self explanatory, and correspond closely to
those used in the GEANT simulation.
